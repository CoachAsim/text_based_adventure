    As a young astronaut aboard the research vessel 'Sagan', you've been tasked with 
    studying a mysterious phenomenon near a black hole in the Cygnus constellation.

    2. Study the effects of gravitational time dilation
    3. Return safely to Earth with your discoveries
    
    Remember: In space, careful observation and scientific thinking are your best tools!
